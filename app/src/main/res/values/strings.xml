    <string name="welcome_details">You were transferred into the Mesa District
        for the last few months of your mission. I got called to be the district leader
        at the same time. That meant I was able to talk to you every day!:)</string>
    <string name="leaving_details">You finished your mission at the end of January
        and I was super sad for you to leave! It was exciting to be able to start emailing
        you as a friend instead of only talking as missionaries.</string>
    <string name="pen_pals_details">During the next several months, we emailed,
        sent super long voice recordings, and wrote letters to each other:)</string>
    <string name="im_home_details">I came home at the end of August and guess who drove
        down for the homecoming! I drove up to your house in Idaho a few days later and
        suddenly we were dating… ;)</string>
    <string name="engaged_details">After just two months of dating, I proposed by showing
        up at your house at night with "mail" for you just like I did in the mission… Except
        this time it was a wedding ring.</string>
    <string name="married_details">We got married in the Bountiful, Utah temple on December
        28th, 2022. We stayed at an AirBnB in Bountiful for a few days and then moved up to our
        new apartment in Rexburg, ID.</string>
