# Overview

This app is like journal app. It tells the story of my wife and I's relationship so far. It has five different pages that show information about five different points in our story. There are previous and next buttons to navigate through the pages. There is also a details button on each page that, if clicked, will display a short paragraph that explains what was happening at that point in time.

My purpose for creating this app was to learn how to stylize the elements on the screen to how I want them. I learned how to round off the corners of pictures, change the size, shape, and color of buttons, change the background color of the screen, etc. It helped me understand more clearly how to personalize my app!

 I used AI to help me learn the syntax for Android Studio but I did not directly copy anything that it generated.

# Future Work

* Finish adding the feature where the picture can be clicked on to show more pictures from that time frame.
* Make it so you can see how many picture there are for time frame through small bubble indicators.
* Figure out how to add videos to Android Studio instead of only images.
